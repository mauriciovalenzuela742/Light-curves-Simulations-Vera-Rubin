This repository contains all the necessary components to simulate light curves for the Rubin Observatory LSST Survey using the SNANA software.It includes:

Configuration instructions for running SNANA on the NLHPC cluster (Leftraru/Guacolda).

Jupyter notebooks (step-by-step tutorials) to generate SIMLIBs from Rubinâ€™s observing strategy, run baseline simulations, and extend SNANA with new transient families based on spectroscopic time series.

SLURM job scripts for large-scale production runs.

Example input files and SIMLIBs for Wide Fast Deep (WFD) and Deep Drilling Fields (DDF).

Documentation and QA tools to validate the simulations.

The goal is to provide a reproducible and extensible framework for generating realistic LSST light curve datasets, supporting transient science and broker training (e.g. ALeRCE).
